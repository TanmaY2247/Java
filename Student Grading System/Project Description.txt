Project Description:
    
    In this project, create a student grading system that allows
    users to input student details and their scores for various
    subjects. The system should calculate the overall grade for
    each student based on their scores and display the result


1.Input student details: Ask the user to enter the student's
                        name, roll number, and the number of subjects.

2.Input subject scores: Based on the number of subjects
                    entered, ask the user to input the scores for each subject.
                    Calculate overall grade: Calculate the overall grade for the
                    student based on their scores. You can use a grading scale
                    such as A+, A, B, C, D, and F.

3.Display result: Display the student's name, roll number,
                subject-wise scores, and overall grade.

4.Repeat for multiple students Allow the user to input details
                        scores for multiple students, and display the results for each student.
